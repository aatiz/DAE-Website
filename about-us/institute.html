                            <p>Purwanchal Campus formerly known as Eastern Region (ERC) Campus is one of
                                    constituent campus of Tribhuvan University (TU) and one of the associate engineering campuses
                                    of Institute of Engineering (IOE) which is a comprehensive, non-profitable making, autonomous
                                    and pioneering institution of higher education level funded by government of Nepal. It is situated
                                    at GangalalMarg, Tinkune, Dharan-8, Sunsari district in the eastern region of Nepal. It occupies
                                    areas of 443 ropani (34-13-11.75 Bigahas) in convenient unit, which is equivalent to about 225.4
                                    square kilometers. It is adjacent to CharkoseJhadi (densely forest) in north and located at entrance
                                    gate by bus of Dharan Sub-metropolitan city.</p>
                            <p>It was established in Paush, 2034 BS under the loan agreement with Asian Development
                                    Bank (ADB). In another agreement with government of United Kingdom (UK) held in Shrawn,
                                    2035BS, the technical assistance was provided by the government of United Kingdom (UK). ERC
                                    was formally organized under Institute of Engineering (IOE), Tribhuvan University (TU) and all
                                    the construction works were completed in 2043 BS.
                                    The campus firstly started trade level courses in Mechanical, Electrical and Civil engineering
                                    streams as specified in the loan and the project agreements. The programs in Diploma in
                                    Mechanical, Electrical, Civil Engineering (3 years) was started since 2043 BS and also
                                    Refrigeration & Air-conditioning Engineering program in 2052 BS, Computer and electronics
                                    engineering program in 2059 BS. In the attempt to further up gradation, IOE/Purwanchal Campus
                                    introduced Bachelor level course that was Bachelor in Engineering (BE) in Agricultural
                                    Engineering in 2057 BS which was first and pioneer in the country. Another BE program in Civil
                                    Engineering was commenced from 2061 BS.The campus was also conducted under Council for Technical Education & Vocational Training
                                    (CTEVT) since 2045/11/12 (BS) by the mandate of Government of Nepal and later again came
                                    back and run under IOE/ TU since 2047/2/15 BS.</p>

                                    Within the framework of development objectives and strategy, IOE/ Purwanchal Campus
                                    has been proposed to developed as focused in center of excellence in engineering education in
                                    eastern region of the country. After successful running the programs in BE in Agricultural and
                                    Civil Engineering, another was started another programs in Electronics & communication Engineering,
                                     Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering in 2069 (BS) and Electrical
                                    Engineering in 2071 (BS) and new program BE in Architecture in 2072 (BS). Till now there are
                                    seven BE engineering programs running in the campus and all trade level courses, three years
